# hello-world
my first repository

I have been a programmer for more than a year. It is my thoughts. But when I met senior developers here when i was hired a student in the office, my thoughts on my ability turned absolutely opposite. I understand one thing: that There are many more things than I thought that I should/must learn about programming. Now I am learning PL Java from the beginning. And I am glad that The God gave me this chance in time.
